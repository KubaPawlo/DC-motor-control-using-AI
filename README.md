# DC-motor-control-using-AI
Engineering thesis â€“ DC motor control using artificial intelligence algorithms.
In the repository, we have included code for testing a genetic algorithm, artificial neural networks, and a decision tree in the context of tuning PID controller parameters and generating voltage sequences to control the rotational speed of a DC motor. There are also included programs for visualizing the obtained results.
